# Samsung-A05s-SM-A057F-SM-A057G-Custom ROMs

### What are Custom ROM's 

A custom ROM is a third-party, modified version of the Android operating system, built from [Android Open Source Project (AOSP)](https://source.android.com/) code to replace a device's stock software. Developed by 3rd Party's, they offer increased customization, sometimes better performance, sometimes better privacy, fewer bloatware apps, and newer Android versions for older devices. 

The Samsung A05s is a cheap Android operating system phone, so to make life easier, this repo investigates what's involved with flashing different Android ROM's to see how they perform and how to build a custom rom because there are no custom rom's for this phone. This will mean an element of detective work will be involved, which can then be applied to other android phone's not currently supported by custom rom's.

Whilst bugs can be found in the phone manufacturer's stock rom's, bugs can also be found in custom rom's, and both can make phone's more unstable especially when you start to use all its features and not just the most popular feature's.


### Why do this?

Bug's in Samsungs OneUI and app's, a clunky not very appealing interface (opinion), to obtain more configurable privacy options, and to make the phone usable for longer so it doesnt become e-waste.

### Why not do this?

Banking app's in particular, may not work so you wont be able to access your bank account's easily. They rely heavily on security measure's which go deep into the Android operating system and hardware, out of the way of your regular mobile phone user so they cant tamper with it.

### How frequently will this repo be updated?

Over the next few months, the time of writing being Feb 2026. This is currently a work in process repo, mainly to investigate whats involved in making a custom rom for educational purposes, nothing more.

### Custom ROM's 

These are some of the off-the-shelf custom rom's which exist for Android phone's (not to be interpreted as endorsements), however none of these can be downloaded and used on a Samsung A05s, so the next steps will be to investigate whats involved in making these work on the Samsung A05s. These custom rom's were current as at Feb 2026.
