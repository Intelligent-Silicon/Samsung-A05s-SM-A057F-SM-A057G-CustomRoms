# What are Custom ROM's 

A custom ROM is a third-party, modified version of the Android operating system, built from [Android Open Source Project (AOSP)](https://source.android.com/) code to replace a device's stock software. Developed by 3rd Party's, they offer increased customization, sometimes better performance, fewer bloatware apps, and newer Android versions for older devices. 

The Samsung A05s is an Android operating system phone, so to make life easier, this repo investigates what's involved with flashing different Android ROM's to see how they perform and how to build a custom rom because there are no custom rom's for this phone. This will mean an element of detective work will be involved. Whilst bugs can be found in stock rom's, bugs can also be found in custom rom's.


# Why do this?

Bug's in Samsungs OneUI and app's, a clunky not very appealing interface (opinion) and to make the phone usable for longer so it doesnt become e-waste.
